        Why will people come? 
        People enjoy going to parties, they enjoy spending time together and sharing moments with family and friends. especially if they are not the ones planning the party, but what about all the people that have to do the planning? Aren’t they supposed to have fun too? It’s always very overwhelming to make sure that everything is ready, or to feel worried about the possibility of forgetting about something, that why people love JustFun, in just fun we want to make sure that every person in the party is enjoying it at its fullest, so we have created this webpage along with a database that will provide all the information you need to be able to plan any type of party from the napkins to the decoration.
        The Platform will allow you to create a username and provide a password so it keeps record of the information you have provided or the type of parties you have requested information for, that way the platform will be able to provide more accurate information, as well as adapt it to the needs of the user, if the users feel pertinent.

      </ul>
      <h3>Type of Party?</h3>
      <p>
        The information provided by the page will be based on the input provided by the users, there will be some simple but very important questions, for example.  Questions such as "Type of Party?" "Number of People"? and "Who from the people will be willing to bring things? With these three basic questions our platform will be able to provide all the information you need to plan a very successful party, there will also be some other questions that will be optional, were more things can be added to the planning process, such as “Do you want games or activities?”, “Host name?” “People leading activities?” “Food Allergies?” and so on and so forth, People will also be able to provide feedback regarding how the page is working when it comes down to helping with the planning as well as for help adding some other questions or features to our platform.

      </ul>
      <h3>MyUser</h3>
      <p>
        Users will be able to add record of likes or dislikes of the common guests as well as possible food allergies so when the web page is provided with the name of the guest will automatically know what to offer, emails of guest could also be provided, our page also offers the possibility to send reminders to the party such as attendance or to the guest that have agreed to bring items to the party that way the host can make sure everyone is ready for the important day. The Best part is that all of this is completely optional, so you can always decide not to add any information, and the page will still provide the information, or the user can decide to do it in different visits, and it wont affect the results of the platform at all.  
        As mentioned previously, our site was thought up and developed to help people ensure having a fun and well-planned party, we want everyone to have fun knowing that everything will be ready and taken for. There aren’t many official sites that help you with this, you can always find general information online, but JustFun will provide accurate and personalized information, as well as a very large range of possible parties and themes.
        Planning parties has never been so easy. You will surely want to have a party every week, and everyone will have the opportunity to enjoy it, and even better, feel the surety that you didn't miss anything.
